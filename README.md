# ViewLayout

ViewLayout is an UIView-associated manager for anchors, using layout guides to resolve constraints.

## Swift Package Manager

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/bogue89/ViewLayoutPackage.git", from: "x.x.x")
```
Add `ViewLayout` to your target's dependencies:
```swift
.target(name: "example", dependencies: ["ViewLayout"]),
```
#### Import package(?)
```swift
import ViewLayout
```
#### Uses
```swift
let view = UIView()
let layout: ViewLayout = view.layout // this lazily initialize the ViewLayout manager for this view instance
```
